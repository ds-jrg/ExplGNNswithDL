# Overview

This is my code, which is part of my work for finding the best explanation for a GNN using class expressions from description logic. Currrently, this is a vast summary of code, but updated versions of this code can be found at `https://github.com/ds-jrg/ExplGNNswithDL`.


# Mathematical Description

Given a GNN G, I am working on methods to derive class expressions C such that ∀x∈G,C(x)⇒G(x)∀x∈G,C(x)⇒G(x).
